# InventoryUI
Inventory application with GUI


This program reads a TXT file line by line and adds it to the GUI.  Make sure you change the 'filename' variable at the top of the code to set a default location.
There is an option to change the directory once the program is already running

Add, Edit, Delete, and Search functions for the TXT file, and displays information in the GUI

Add, Edit, Delete, only opens the file as the command executes then closes file, so multiple people can use at the same time as long as they don't click a command
button in the same 1/2 second.
